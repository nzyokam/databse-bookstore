# üìö Bookstore Database

This project defines a relational database schema for a bookstore system. It includes tables for managing customers, books, authors, orders, addresses, and access control through user roles. The structure is normalized and supports real-world operations such as multi-author books, multiple addresses per customer, and order tracking.

## üì¶ Features

- Customers and their contact info
- Support for multiple addresses per customer with status
- Books with authors, publishers, and languages
- Order system with order lines, status history, and shipping methods
- Role-based user access (Admin, Developer, Employee)
